 * There are 5 main colors: 3 orange variations, two green. The three orange variations seem to have 3 purposes:
 * 1) a color to represent user-responsive (user can affect it) 2) a 'background/unfocused' color 3) a 'focused'
 * color. The two green variations seem to have similar purposes, a 'focused' and 'unfocused/background' color
 * (these will just be secondary-color and secondary-light-color since there are only 2).
